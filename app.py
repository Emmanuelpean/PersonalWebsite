    #### Research Experience
    **Investigating charge carrier dynamics in organic and inorganic materials using time-resolved microwave conductivity (Research Fellow, March 2022, IMPACT, Swansea University, UK)**
    I am currently working on building a time-resolved microwave photoconductivity setup to investigate charge carrier dynamics in perovskite solar cells.

    **Investigating charge carrier recombination and time-resolved photoluminescence of perovskite materials for solar cell applications (Postdoc, July 2020, SPECIFIC, Swansea University, UK)**
    My role was to investigate charge carrier recombination in perovskite materials using simulations and experimental measurement of time-resolved photoluminescence and how these can be used to improve the efficient of perovskite solar cells.

    **Unraveling the photochemistry of perovskite materials for solar cell applications (PhD, October 2016 - March 2020, Swansea University, Swansea, UK)**
    My PhD project focused on the photochemical properties of perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications. I studied 
    photobrightening, photodarkening, charge carrier recombination kinetic and superoxide formation in perovskites using a wide range of 
    experimental techniques including time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, x-ray diffractometry, optical and electron microscopy, 
    spectrophotometry and the dihydroethidium fluorescence probe.

    **Investigating point defects in CdIn2S4 through density function theory (MSc thesis, February-June 2016, Institut des mat√©riaux de Nantes - CNRS, Nantes, France)**
    Using density functional theory, I calculated the formation energy of point defects in the CdIn2S4 and related it to the experimentally 
    measured doping. I also developed a software to plot density of states and calculate the formation energy and concentration of point defects 
    in semiconductors from output files from the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package software.

    **Electric grid modelling and simulation (April-May 2015, Centre for Integrated Renewable Energy Generation and Supply, Cardiff, UK)**
    I studied the role of electric interconnections between France and Great Britain in the integration of renewable energy sources in 2030 using the PLEXOS Integrated Energy Model software.""",
